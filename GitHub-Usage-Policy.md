# Policy on Daily Use of GitHub - Project Management and Performance Evaluation

1. Purpose and Scope: This policy establishes guidelines for the use of GitHub as a tool for project management and performance evaluation at RevelTek. It applies to all employees, interns, and volunteers regardless of their role, and is intended to ensure consistency, transparency, and accountability in our operations.

2. Policy Statement: All employees are required to use Github on a daily basis to track their tasks, whether they are related to software development or general business operations. The contributions made by each employee on Github will serve as a key indicator of their performance, attendance, and productivity.

3. Performance Evaluation: The evaluation of an employee's performance will be based on their Github contributions. This includes but is not limited to, the quality of their work, the timeliness of their contributions, and their overall engagement with the projects they are assigned to.

4. Attendance: An employee's Github contributions will also serve as a record of their attendance. Any employee who fails to make any contributions on a given day will be considered absent for that day. 

5. Resignation Policy: If an employee is absent for a day without notifying their manager and fails to make any Github contributions, it will be considered as an act of resignation. In such cases, the employee will not be eligible for any further compensation.

6. Ethics and Security: All employees are expected to adhere to ethical guidelines and security protocols while using Github. Any violation of these guidelines or protocols will be subject to disciplinary action.  You will never mention a client name or co-worker name in any commit you make. We will respect privacy at all times on all of our contributions.

7. Productivity Bonuses: Employees' Github profiles will be reviewed to determine their eligibility for productivity bonuses. The criteria for these bonuses will include the number and quality of contributions made, as well as the employee's overall engagement with their projects.

8. Implementation and Compliance: All managers are responsible for ensuring that their team members are aware of and comply with this policy. Any questions or concerns about this policy should be directed to the RevOps department.

This policy is effective immediately and supersedes any previous policies or guidelines on the use of GitHub for project management and performance evaluation.
